# Robotic Cell Design for Automated Injection Moulding Crate Production

This repository contains the project report for the MNFG309: Industrial Robotics and Automated Assembly course. The project involves the design of a robotic cell for the full automation of the production of injection moulded crates, including the removal of die flash and suitable stacking or removal from the work area.


## Task Description

The project aims to fully automate the process of producing injection moulded crates. Currently, the operation of the injection moulding machine is automated, but the removal of the crates and the die flash is done manually. The objective is to design a robotic cell to automate the following tasks:
- Removal of the crates from the injection moulding machine
- Removal of the die flash
- Stacking of the crates and/or removal from the work area
